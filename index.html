    <p class="p1">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference in that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javaScript</p>
    <p class="p1">In CSS, selector are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element. </p>
    <p class="p1">There is a wide range of selevtors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target element to which a style should be applied. </p>
